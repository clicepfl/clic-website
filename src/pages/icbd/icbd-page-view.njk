                                    One of our key highlights: throughout the day, you will have the opportunity to take part in mock interviews, tailored for IC students.
                                    Recruiters from big tech companies such as Google will run simulated interviews in groups. This unique experience will allow
                                    you to build confidence for your next real world interview.

                                    During your Master studies, you are required to take an internship in the industry. Many IC students also chose to do their Master thesis during this internship. Guillermo Barrenetxea Kobas, recruiter at Swisscom, will explain what behaviour to adopt during your internship, how to expand your network and how to make the most out of your experience.
