                                    several alumni working in the same field will come to give a quick overview of a project they worked on before discussing their 
                                    daily routine and give you insights on what your future work life may look like. We will host alumni working in domains such

                                    to ask them any question you'd like! This will be a standing lunch so that you can walk around and

                                    It will soon be the time for you to dive into the working world but you perhaps have a few concerns or questions. This is why we 
                                    are inviting alumni to talk about their own experience on diverse subjects. This discussion-oriented activity will allow you to 
                                    engage in interesting conversations with alumni who already went through some of your interrogations and have great insights about them. 
                                    The featured subjects are : “Master completed, what now ? Research, industry, both ?”, “What is it like to work in the IT field as a 
                                    woman ?”, “Should I aim for a more ethical company and if so, what are they like ?”, “What is it like to work in big-tech 
                                    companies such as the GAFAS ?” and finally, “How about working in a start-up?”.
