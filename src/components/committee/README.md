# Committee component documentation

This is the committee component, you are in folder `src/components/committee/`.

## Modifying the committee list

This is a simple guide for content editors to modify the committee list (wherever used on the website). If you are are developer, use the standard workflow as described in the [top-level README](/README.md).

1. Fork this repository to your account using the `Fork` button in the top right corner of this page on Github

2. You need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on machine, then clone your fork to your computer.

    ```
    cd ~/Documents
    git clone <YOUR_FORK_URL>
    ```

    where `<YOUR_FORK_URL>` is for instance `https://github.com/<username>/clic-website.git`

3. Open your favorite code editor, navigate to this folder (`src/components/committee/`) and modify [`committee-list.json`](committee-list.json), which contains an array of object literals for each committee member. Each member must be of the following form, case-sensitive and separated by commas:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "role": "DÃ©monstrateur d'exemple",
        "imageURL": "/committee/johndoe.jpg",
        "websiteURL": "https://people.epfl.ch/john.doe"
    }
    ```

    - the `name` property is a string with the member's full firstname and surname
    - the `role` property is a string with the member's role within the association
    - the `imageURL` property is a string with the absolute remote url to the image
        - images must be located inside the local `assets` folder in this component's folder: the corresponding absolute remote url is the image name inside prepended with `/committee/` (example: image `johndoe.jpg` placed locally in `assets/` will have `imageURL` set to `/committee/johndoe.jpg`)
        - if no image is available for this member, you can use `/committee/default.jpg`
    - the `websiteURL` property is a string with the URL to the EPFL people page of the member

4. Test your changes if you want to
    1. you will need NodeJS installed, [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
    2. navigate to the root of the repository and compile the software
        ```
        cd ~/Documents/clic-website/
        npm install && npm start
        ```
    3. you can then access your changes locally at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
    - refer to the [top-level README](/README.md) for issues troubleshooting

5. Commit and push your changes **in this folder only** to your fork

    ```
    cd ~/Documents/clic-website/
    cd src/components/committee/
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update committee list"
    git push -v origin master
    ```

    Please do not commit any other files outside of this component's folder (the above commands will do the job).

6. Create a new pull request and let the developers merge the update into the master branch
    1. Go to the [Pull Requests page](https://github.com/clicepfl/clic-website/pulls)
    2. Select `New pull request`
    3. Select `Compare across forks`
    4. Select your fork as `head repository` and compare your `master` branch against ours
    5. Have a last look at your changes and hit `Create pull request`

7. Only once your change has been merged back into master by the developers, delete your fork on Github and your local copy of the repository to ensure that you will not have a stale version later in the future (developers should notify you in your Pull Request).

## Developer notes

The component is defined by 3 additional files:

- [`committee-router.ts`](committee-router.ts) mounts the local `assets` folder into the top-level router and assigns their URLs
- [`committee-view.njk`](committee-view.njk) contains view components definitions to display the committee, such as the grid view.
- [`committee.ts`](committee.ts) contains the internal representation of a committee member (type `Staff`) and the reusable `CommitteeComponent` definition
