# CLIC website software

Welcome to the repository of the CLIC website software! It contains code for the web server behind [clic.epfl.ch](https://clic.epfl.ch).

All decisions, features, bugs, enhancements and discussions for this repo take place in the [Github issues](https://github.com/clicepfl/clic-website/issues), please have a look and exchange ideas there.

If you're contributing to this repo, you're probably either a:

- Content editor (news, sponsors, committee, ...): refer to the [editor guides section](#editor-guides) to read instructions on how to modify your corresponding component
- IT tasked with deployment: you may want to read [the technology stack](#technology-stack) and [how to build locally](#building-and-testing-locally). However we have an actual deployment repository with scripts to automate installation and updates at [clic-website-production](https://github.com/clicepfl/clic-website-production).
- Web developer: you probably want to get familiar with the complete codebase, so keep reading :stuck_out_tongue: Please make sure that you are at ease with the [workflow](#workflow) before committing new code.
