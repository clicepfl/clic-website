# CLIC website software

Welcome to the repository of the CLIC website software! It contains code for the web server behind [clic.epfl.ch](https://clic.epfl.ch).

All decisions, features, bugs, enhancements and discussions for this repo take place in the [Github issues](https://github.com/clicepfl/clic-website/issues), please have a look and exchange ideas there.

If you're contributing to this repo, you're probably either a:

- Content editor (news, sponsors, committee, ...): refer to the [editor guides section](#editor-guides) to read instructions on how to modify your corresponding component
- IT tasked with deployment: you may want to read the [technology stack](#technology-stack) and [how to build locally](#building-and-testing-locally). However we have an actual deployment repository with scripts to automate installation and updates at [clic-website-production](https://github.com/clicepfl/clic-website-production).
- Web developer: you probably want to get familiar with the complete codebase, so keep reading :stuck_out_tongue: Please make sure that you are at ease with the [workflow](#workflow) before committing new code.

## Editor guides

## Technology stack

## Building and testing locally

> **Note:** these instructions are not meant for production deployment. Please refer to the [clic-website-production](https://github.com/clicepfl/clic-website-production) repository for this purpose.

You will need git, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (>12.13.1) installed on your operating system (Windows, Mac or Linux). Make sure that `node` and `npm` are visible on your PATH environment variable, i.e. from your command line:

```
node --version
```

should return something like `v12.13.1`.

Then, assuming you have [setup your SSH keys](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh), you can clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:clicepfl/clic-website.git
```

Enter the newly created directory and run the installation script which will fetch the required dependencies and compile our source files such as Typescript and Sass:

```
cd clic-website
npm install
```

Once this is done, you can run the server locally with:

```
npm start
```

After this command, your terminal should hang with `Web server started on port 8000 in DEBUG mode`. You can then access the local server in your web browser at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

You can stop the server by entering `Ctrl+C` in the terminal (this shortcut does not mean `copy`! It sends a `SIGINT` to interrupt the running process).

### Installation troubleshooting

This is a list of issues that you may encounter when installing or starting the server. Feel free to add your own problem and solution, otherwise head over to the [Github issues](https://github.com/clicepfl/clic-website/issues).

- If you have previously installed an older version of Typescript globally, you may encounter an error such as `ts5023: unknown compiler option 'resolveJsonModule'`. Uninstall your global version of Typescript or update it to the latest (`npm remove -g typescript` or `npm install -g typescript@latest`).

- When running `npm start`, the message `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::8000` may appear in a long stacktrace. This means that your local port `8000` is already used by another process, you will need to stop it before trying again.

### Building during development

The `npm install` command is only required once when you first install the repository. If you then make changes to the repository, you can simply run `npx gulp` to compile your sources (it will be faster than `npm install` as it will not fetch dependencies). Then, re-start the server with `npm start`.
